Online Tutorials
================

Software Carpentry will be offering online help to folks that have taken a boot
camp with us.  Think of this like a tutorial or office hours where people can
come to ask specific questions related to the work they are doing. 

### Office Hours

TBD once we find out who is available and when, and scale to demand. 

### Tutor availability

slots you regularly have available below (including any exceptions you know of).
